    <h1>HOW TO USE <i>EITHER</i> OR <i>NEITHER</i> IN ENGLISH GRAMMAR:</h2>
    <p>What is the difference between <i>neither</i> and <i>either</i>, and how they are used.</p>

    <Strong>Answer:</Strong>
    <ol class="primary">
        <li><i>Either</i> and <i>neither's</i> meaning change in accordance with
            the context of a sentence.</li>
       <li><i>Either</i> is generally considered as positive and <i>neither</i> is opposite (negative).</li>
        <li>They are generally used when we talk about one or two persons, things etc.. <span class="part">[PLEASE NOTE THAT: THEY ARE NOT USED WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MORE THAN TWO PERSONS OR THINGS.]</span></li>
         <li><i>Either</i> and <i>neither</i> can be used as:</li>

         <ol class="secondary" >
            <li>Adjective</li>
            <li>Pronoun</li>
            <li>Conjunction</li>
            <li>Adverb</li>
         </ol>
    </ol>

    <p>When used as an Adjective <i>either</i> means "one or the other of two people or things," and <i>neither</i> means "not one or othes of two people or things." In other words, we can say that <i>neither</i> means <i>"not either"</i>. The following example sentence show its use: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>You may borrow either book. [You may borrow one or the other of two books]</li>
        <li>You may borrow neither book. [You may not borrow one or the other of two books, you may not borrow either book.]</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When used an a <strong>pronoun</strong> <i>either</i> means "one or the other." <i>Neither</i> means "not the one and not the other" or "not either". The following example sentence show its usage:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You may wear either dresses to the party. [You may wear one dress or you may wear the other dress]</li>
        <li>You may wear neithers of the dresses to the party. [You may not wear the one dress or you may not wear the other dresses; you may not wear the either dress]</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When used as <strong>conjunction</strong> <i>either</i> is used with "or" to indicate choices and possibilities. <i>Neither</i> is used with "nor" to indicate two or more people, things and actions etc. about which something is not true. The following sentence example show its use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I will eat either chicken or fish tonight. [I will choose one of two options]</li>
        <li>I wll eat neither chicken or fish tonight. [I will not eat chicken and I will not eat fish; I will not choose either of these two foods]</li>
    </ul>
